# OpenGL_GP1
This repo is for my project in subject Graphics Programming using C++ and OpenGL to generate graphical images in 2D and 3D.

First exercise in this subject is to create Menger Sponge using OpenGL, control the rotation axis in x and y and also change the color of the cube using ImGUI.

Tutorial, which I was using, is on the official site of OpenGL called LearnOpenGL.
